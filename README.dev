** RELEASE PROCESS **

Quick notes on the current release process:

* Increment the version number as needed: one place in the tail_n_mail file, one in the README.md file
* Update the Changes file: add the latest version, put a release date, and adjust the spacing.
* Generate a new tail_n_mail.asc file
* Make sure everything is committed in git
* Add a new tag: git tag -u 14964ac8 1.2.3 -m "Version 1.26.3, released September 24, 2013"
* git push; git push --tags

In the bucardo_org repo:
* Edit tail_n_mail/index.md (mostly bump the version at the top)
* Edit _data/projects.yml and update the version and release date
* git commit and git push

Login to the bucardo.org box, and then:

* cd ~/tail_n_mail; git pull
* cp tail_n_mail* ~/downloads/
* Edit ~/www/tail_n_mail/latest_version.txt
* cd ~; make (this automatically applies the bucardo_org changes above)

* Send an email to tnm-announce@bucardo.org. See announcements/ for examples.

* Put the new email into announcements/
