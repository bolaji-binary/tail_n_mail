Changes in version 3.0.0:

* Major version bump!

* Minimum Perl version is now 5.8.0

* Config files are now static, and will not get rewritten. Instead, 
  we start using "state" files to track information that changes 
  each run. With this change, config files to be easily tracked in git.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Show a breakdown of how many matches came from each file on multi-file matches
  Controlled with the "show_file_numbers" variable (defaults to 1)
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Allow service file to have the "latest"
  Format is: SERVICE=name LATEST
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Redo the 'duration' type system entirely.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Improve sorting of items to use the timestamp before the line number.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Add new config file option "NO_INHERIT" to prevent the inherited 
  files from setting things (esp. 'include' and 'exclude')

* New command line option "--start_time", in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS, 
  which ignores existing offsets and tries to do things by date only.
  Requires your log files start with the same format.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Allow 'all' as an option to the --skip_report_failing_host option.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Throw an exception if duplicate FILE entries are loaded
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Minor adjustments to folding in failed connection attempts, and in deadlock errors.
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]

* Better flattening of EXECUTE arguments, lines with PID arguments
  [Greg Sabino Mullane]
