Version 2.4.0 of tail_n_mail has just been released.  It should be available 
on the website soon, or you can grab git tag 2.4.0. Work is ongoing for 
version 2.5.0 as well: please send an email or raise a github issue for 
any problems/requests.

Changes in version 2.4.0:

 * Support for pgbouncer logs. Just give your config file the string 'bouncer' in it to activate.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Handle cases in which the log files contain null bytes.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Do not attempt to failed service twice, if host is the same but file is different.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Output why some files were skipped in the header for serious issues.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Add flattening for non-Postgres files
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Allow custom flattening rules via FLATTEN: in the config file
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Rather than [A], [B], etc., show the service names themselves in the output if all 
   of the files are using service names (unless the name is the same).
   Can be forced to the old behavior with --force-letter-output.
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Better flattening of queries
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Do not show any file summaries if --mailzero was triggered
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Fix tracking of line number position
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Report pg_read_file failures rather than exiting the whole program
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Allow pg_read_file to handle very large files smoothly
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]

 * Add 'hide_conflict_error_details' option to merge all "conflict with recovery" strings
   [Greg Sabino Mullane]
